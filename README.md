# ecs-demo
In this repo I would like to demo how to create an ecs task with terraform, display  something received from dynamodb on a publicly available API.


## Best practices
Following best practices from here:

## How to test
Not sure how to resolve path issue, this seems like a good fix. 
Supports:
- running from terminal
``` sh 
python -m pytest tests
```

- running from VS Code test runner


(by default, running only "pytest" should work.)
